# pytr_custom_sort

Personalized sorting of documents downloaded with [pytr](https://github.com/pytr-org/pytr) from Trade Republic.

## Overview

If you want to organize your Trade Republic documents downloaded with pytr in your own custom way, this tool provides a flexible, rule-based sorting system. Define your sorting rules in YAML format and let the tool automatically organize your documents.

## Prerequisites

- Python with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended for easier dependency management)
- [pytr](https://github.com/pytr-org/pytr) for downloading Trade Republic documents

> **💡 Tip:** I recommend using the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for a more comfortable Python experience. It's fast, reliable, and handles dependencies seamlessly. If you don't have it yet, install it with:
>
> ```bash
> # Windows (PowerShell)
> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
> 
> # Windows (WinGet)
> winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
>
> # macOS/Linux
> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
> ```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ExploracuriousAlex/pytr_custom_sort.git
